# Jimmy Nicholas - Portfolio & Blog

A personal portfolio and blog showcasing my work as a developer, educator, and musician. Built with Next.js and TypeScript, featuring a clean design that adapts to both business and creative contexts.

The site includes project showcases, educational content, and insights from my experience in software development and music. It's designed to be accessible, performant, and reflective of my approach to both technical and creative work.
